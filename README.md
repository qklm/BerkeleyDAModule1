# Kickstarter Challenge

## Purpose
  Under what parameters have kickstarters between 2009 and 2017 in theatrical productions been successful, failed, or canceled. These parameters include: cost, timing of launch, timing of end of campaign. The intersection of these criteria will help guide the decision of when to launch and what to expect from a budgetary perspective.
  
## Challenges & Analysis 

  I did not encounter any ultimately difficult challenges. COUNTIF syntax took a while to get my head around, but easily implemented and overall pretty forgiving once I got a handle of it. Potential challenges would probably revolve around not being particularly comfortable using Excel in general. Clarity in module instruction was generally good, though in some instances the pacing of instruction felt inconsistent, i.e. 1 instruction per text block then 3 instructions per text block. Ultimately not terribly significant.
  
## Results
  According to [Outcomes based on funding goals](https://github.com/qklm/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) the largest deviations in success and failure are in the monetary goal ranges of $25,000 to $25,999 and $45,000 to $49,999. And according to [Outcomes based on Month of Launch](https://github.com/qklm/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Laucnh.png), the most successful month of launch for a campaign is May, and the least successful is a little harder to pin down with any certainy as the deviation between the least successful months is low. December is however the overwhelmingly the worst month to launch a campaign in this space with nearly 50% of total launches failing.
  This approach to the dataset is limited in scope as we did not account for when campaigns end, nor how long those campaigns ran for. The inclusion of canceled projects also clutters the more meaningful results, and were not statistically significant. 
  It would also be beneficial, albeit a little more legwork to take into consideration: subject matter, length of play, and narrowed down the location of launch (a play set to launch in Kentucky will likely be less successful in meeting its funding goals than a play launched in New York).
